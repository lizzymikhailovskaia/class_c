//This is assignment for Geometry Calculator = IF ELSE

//Write a program that displays the following menu:
//Geometry Calculator
//1. Calculate the area of a circle
//2. Calculate the area of a rectangle
//3. Calculate the area of a triangle
//4. Quit

//Enter your choice (1-4):

//If the user enters 1, the program should ask for the radius of the circle and then display its area.
//Use the following formula:
//Area = pi * r^2
//Use 3.14159 for pi and the radius of the circle for r.

//If the user enters 2, the program should ask for the length and the width
// of the rectangle and then display the rectangle's area.
//Use the following formula:
//area = length*width

//If the user enters 3 the program should ask for the length 
//of the triangle's base and its height and then display its area.
//Use the following formula:
//area = base * height  * .5

//If the user enters 4, the program should end.

//Input Validation: Display an error message if the user enters a number
//outside the range of 1 through 4 when selecting an item from the menu.
//Do not accept negative values for the circle's radius,
//the rectangle's length or width, or the triangle's base or height.
