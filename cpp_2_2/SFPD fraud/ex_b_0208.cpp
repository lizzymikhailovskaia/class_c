/*The SFPD fraud unit was happy with your program to help detect credit card
fraud and have a new assignment for you.  They have given you a list of 20
known credit card fraudsters at large, and want you to write a program that
can detect if one of them attempting to purchase something at the local Target store.
Unfortunately, the SFPD has not sorted the list for you, so your program must sort the list first
•You can get a file with the list of names from my website and save it in your hills directory using cp.
cp /pub/cs/mhtam/spring2018/cs110b/names.txt .•Your program should:•read in the
20 names from the file into an array of 20 string objects•sort the array using either bubble sort or selection sort
•ask the user for the last name of a customer who is attempting to use a credit card.
•wait after 2nd part of the lecture:: search your array to see if this name is on the fraudster list.
At first, you can use a linear search like last time.  If you have time, you can use a binary search because the list is sorted.*/
