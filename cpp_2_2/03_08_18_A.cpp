/*
1.The local taqueria wants you to write a program which tracks the number
of burritos they sell each day and help them analyze their business.

2.Your program should prompt the user for the number of different types sold,
then get the names of the types and the number of burritos sold of each type of that day.
Print out a daily report listing sales for each burrito type and total number of burritos sold.

3.You must use a struct called salesRecord which has two fields -- a string containing the name of the burrito,
and an int containing the number of burritos sold of this type.
You must have one dynamically allocated array of salesRecord structs.
